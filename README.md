# PyTutor

An application to manage the process of timetabling lectures and detecting clashes.
This is not an automatic scheduler. The aim of this project was to provide and interface where lectures  and administrators can collaborate to create a time table. The program reads in a csv file that is generated from a database and use it to create a time table that is editable and in a display form that is easier to understand than the original format. When entering or importing data, the applicaton will detect clashes or any other anomolies in the data.
